# OOP_Snippets

This repository contains **intentionally incomplete code**.
The beauty of classes & objects is you can easily add or modify actions and attribtes now. You can borrow this code without citing or losing 20% borrowed points. 

The scripts contain instructions on how to use the methods, including suggeste attributes. 

## Read the descriptions carefully
## Do not borrow code you do not understand!
This means you should take the time to:
- **play** (_what happens when you change parameters? Values?_)
- **read the documentation** on new methods in pygame. (_does it do what you think it does? Can you improve upon it for your code?_)
(https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html)[Pygame Docummentation]

## After copying code
1. Run it and see what errors come up.
2. Use the tracebacks to locate values or names that need to be **created** or changed to get the method to work
3. **Change the code** you will probably have to change code in conditionals or loops to do exactly what you need
4. Celebrate!

## What's the "event for loop"?
This thing, inside your while loop:
```
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if (event.type == pygame.QUIT):
            pygame.quit()
```

## You can borrow ALL of this repository code for free! (No citation needed, no borrow limit application)
